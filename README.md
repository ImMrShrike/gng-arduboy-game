# Games'n Goblins: The game
This is my first attempt to make a game for Arduboy.

This is a clone of another game named Assembloids.

How to play: 
1. Each face is made up of 4 pieces, assemble the faces by fitting the quarters together. 
2. Complete a face in the exact way to score more points (10 points for a completely messy face, 40 points for a part mixed face, 100 points in case only one part is out of place and 300 points for a complete face).
3. When you clear the entire board, you get an extra life plus 500 bonus points.
